# Cross-Lingual Model Merging Analysis Report

## Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of cross-lingual model merging experiments conducted across 45 languages. The study compares two merging strategies (similarity-based and average-based) against zero-shot cross-lingual performance.

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance Summary
- **Total Languages Analyzed**: 45
- **Average Baseline (Finetuned)**: 0.8466
- **Average Similarity Merge**: 0.6507
- **Average Average Merge**: 0.6559
- **Average Zero-shot Performance**: 0.6529

### Merging Effectiveness vs Zero-shot
- **Languages with positive improvement**: 34/45 (75.6%)
- **Languages with negative improvement**: 11/45 (24.4%)
- **Average improvement over zero-shot**: +0.0004 (slight positive)

### Method Comparison
- **Similarity merge performs better**: 21 languages
- **Average merge performs better**: 24 languages

## Top Performing Languages

### Most Successful Merges (Biggest Improvement over Zero-shot)

2. **jv-ID (Javanese)**: +0.0415 improvement (similarity merge)
3. **am-ET (Amharic)**: +0.0398 improvement (similarity merge)
4. **tl-PH (Tagalog)**: +0.0356 improvement (average merge)
5. **ka-GE (Georgian)**: +0.0320 improvement (similarity merge)

### Languages Where Merging Hurts Performance
1. **ms-MY (Malay)**: -0.0358 (similarity), -0.0341 (average)
2. **ja-JP (Japanese)**: -0.0307 (similarity), -0.0381 (average)
3. **vi-VN (Vietnamese)**: -0.0303 (both methods)
4. **en-US (English)**: -0.0409 (similarity), -0.0261 (average)
5. **ko-KR (Korean)**: -0.0211 (similarity), -0.0335 (average)

## Interesting Patterns

### Languages with Large Method Differences
1. **tl-PH (Tagalog)**: Similarity merge (-0.0579) vs Average merge (+0.0356)
2. **ar-SA (Arabic)**: Similarity merge (-0.0633) vs Average merge (+0.0260)
3. **ru-RU (Russian)**: Similarity merge (-0.0594) vs Average merge (+0.0047)

### Language Families and Merging Success
**Indo-European Languages**: Generally show positive improvements
- Germanic languages (de-DE, nl-NL, sv-SE): Small positive improvements
- Romance languages (es-ES, fr-FR, pt-PT): Mixed results

**Asian Languages**: Mixed performance
- Southeast Asian (vi-VN, tl-PH): Variable success
- East Asian (ja-JP, ko-KR): Generally negative improvements

**Low-Resource Languages**: Often show good improvements
- cy-GB (Welsh): Best overall improvement
- km-KH (Khmer), jv-ID (Javanese): Strong positive results

## Key Insights

### 1. Merging is Generally Beneficial
75.6% of languages show improvement over zero-shot performance, suggesting that combining multiple language models is generally better than using individual cross-lingual models.

### 2. No Single Best Method
The effectiveness of similarity-based vs average-based merging varies significantly by language, indicating that the optimal strategy depends on the specific target language and its linguistic relationships.

### 3. Resource Level Matters
Lower-resource languages often benefit more from merging, possibly because they gain more from the additional linguistic knowledge transferred from related languages.

### 4. Language Family Influence
Languages from the same family often show similar patterns of merging success, suggesting that linguistic similarity plays a role in determining optimal merging strategies.

## Recommendations

### For Practitioners
1. **Experiment with both methods**: Test both similarity-based and average-based merging for each target language
2. **Consider resource level**: Lower-resource languages may benefit more from aggressive merging strategies
3. **Analyze language relationships**: Consider linguistic family and typological features when selecting source languages

### For Future Research
1. **Investigate language-specific factors**: Study why certain languages respond better to specific merging strategies
2. **Dynamic merging strategies**: Develop methods that adaptively choose merging strategies based on language characteristics
3. **Hierarchical merging**: Explore merging within language families before cross-family merging

## Generated Files

The analysis generated the following files for detailed examination:

## Conclusion

The cross-lingual model merging approach shows promise, with 75.6% of languages achieving better performance than zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. However, the effectiveness varies significantly by language and merging strategy, suggesting that language-specific optimization is crucial for maximizing the benefits of model merging.

The results indicate that merging is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a powerful tool that requires careful consideration of target language characteristics and appropriate method selection.
