# Ablation: Soft Projection Alpha Sweep for Directional Consensus
#
# Purpose: Find optimal alpha value for soft projection
#   - alpha=0.0: No projection (equivalent to similarity method)
#   - alpha=1.0: Full projection (current directional_consensus)
#   - 0 < alpha < 1: Interpolate, preserving some orthogonal signal
#
# Hypothesis: Intermediate alpha values may balance variance reduction
# (helping interference targets) while preserving beneficial orthogonal
# components (helping synergy targets).
#
# Targets:
#   - sw-KE: Synergy target (+2.30% Merging Effect) - hurt by alpha=1.0
#   - cy-GB: Interference target (-1.58% Merging Effect) - helped by alpha=1.0
#
# Expected runs: 2 locales x 5 alpha values = 10 runs
