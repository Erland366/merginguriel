# Ablation: Expanded Validation for Merging Effect Predictor V2
#
# Purpose: Test predictor accuracy on 12 new targets across the score spectrum
#
# Target Selection Strategy:
# - HIGH coherence + HIGH score (4): Test if regional coherence enables synergy
# - MIDDLE score, MIXED coherence (4): Calibrate the decision boundary
# - LOW score (4): Confirm interference predictions
#
# Expected runs: 12 locales × 1 method × 1 similarity × 1 num_languages = 12 runs

# Success Criteria:
# - High-coherence targets: Should show SYNERGY (Merging Effect > 0%)
# - Middle-score targets: Help calibrate decision boundary
# - Low-score targets: Should show INTERFERENCE (Merging Effect < 0%)
# - Target accuracy: 9/12 (75%) or better
