# Ablation: Validate optimal config on BOTH constructive targets
#
# Purpose: Test if our decision tree recommendations work for both constructive locales
# Key finding: Only 2 locales have ZS/Self < 60% (cy-GB: 53.6%, sw-KE: 56.4%)
#
# Expected runs: 2 locales × 2 similarity types × 2 num_languages = 8 runs
