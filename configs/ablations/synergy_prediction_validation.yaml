# Ablation: Validate Synergy Prediction Model
#
# Purpose: Test if our synergy_score predictor correctly identifies targets that
#          benefit from merging (high score) vs those that suffer interference (low score)
#
# Predictor formula: synergy_score = diversity_score / (1 + source_acc_std * 10)
# Key feature: diversity_score has +0.83 correlation with actual Merging Effect
#
# Expected runs: 6 locales × 1 method × 1 similarity × 1 num_languages = 6 runs

# Validation success criteria:
# - High-synergy targets (az-AZ, tr-TR, af-ZA): Merging Effect > 0%
# - Low-synergy targets (am-ET, tl-PH, id-ID): Merging Effect < 0%
# - Predictor validated if 5/6 predictions match
