# MergingUriel: The Living Modular Blueprint

## 0. Document Control

**Document Status: LIVING DOCUMENT - Last Updated: 2025-10-15 06:00 UTC**

**The Golden Rule:** This document, `CLAUDE.md`, is the single source of truth for this project. Any developer, human or AI, who modifies the codebase, adds a feature, or changes a workflow **must** update the relevant sections of this document in the same commit/change. This ensures the documentation remains synchronized with the code.

**A Note to Future Developers (Human or AI):** Before committing any changes, you are required to read this document to understand the project's standards and architecture. After implementing your changes, you **must** update the relevant sections of this `CLAUDE.md` file and modify the `Last Updated` date and time above. This is a mandatory step for all contributions.

## 0.1. Development Principles

### **üö´ NO FALLBACKS - FAIL FAST PRINCIPLE**

**Critical Rule:** NEVER implement fallback mechanisms (dummy data, default values, graceful degradation) in production code during development.

**Why:**
- **Immediate Error Detection:** Fallbacks mask real issues and delay debugging
- **Clear Failure Signals:** Scripts should fail immediately when something is wrong
- **Development Transparency:** No silent failures or misleading "success" messages
- **Research Integrity:** Results must reflect real data, not synthetic substitutes

**Examples of FORBIDDEN Fallbacks:**
```python
# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
try:
    dataset = load_dataset("AmazonScience/massive", locale, split="test")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading dataset: {e}")
    # Fallback to dummy data - FORBIDDEN!
    dataset = create_dummy_data()  # üö´ FORBIDDEN
```

**Required Approach:**
```python
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
dataset = load_dataset("AmazonScience/massive", locale, split="test", trust_remote_code=True)
# Let the script fail if data loading fails - this reveals the real issue immediately
```

**Enforcement:**
- All PRs must be checked for fallback patterns
- Any fallback mechanism must be justified and documented
- Development phase requires immediate failure on any error
- Fallbacks only allowed in production with explicit monitoring

## 1. Introduction & Goal

**MergingUriel** is a research project focused on exploring the efficacy of merging pre-trained language models to create a new, effective model for a target language without requiring training from scratch.

The core hypothesis is that by intelligently combining models from languages that are typologically similar to a target language, we can create a high-performing model that leverages the knowledge embedded in existing artifacts. This approach aims to significantly reduce the computational cost and time required to support new languages.

-   **Base Model:** `xlm-roberta-base`
-   **Primary Dataset:** `AmazonScience/massive` for intent classification tasks.
-   **Guiding Principle:** [URIEL](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/uriel.html) typological vectors serve as the "knowledge base" to determine language similarity and guide the merging process.

## 2. System Architecture

The project follows a modular, multi-stage architecture. The end-to-end workflow is orchestrated to allow for experimentation with different weighting schemes and merging algorithms.

### Data Flow

1.  **Source Models:** The process begins with a collection of individual models, each fine-tuned on the `massive` dataset for a specific language (e.g., `en-US`, `fr-FR`). These models are trained using the `merginguriel/training_bert.py` script.
2.  **Similarity Matrix Processing:** The system uses a pre-computed cosine similarity matrix (`language_similarity_matrix_unified.csv`) containing URIEL typological similarity scores between all language pairs. This matrix is processed on-demand using the `similarity_utils.py` module:
    - **Top-K Filtering**: For a given target language, only the top-K most similar languages are retained (configurable via `--top-k` parameter)
    - **Sinkhorn Normalization**: The filtered similarity scores are normalized using the Sinkhorn algorithm to create a doubly stochastic distribution (rows sum to 1)
    - **Dynamic Processing**: This allows experimentation with different top-K values without regenerating the entire similarity matrix
3.  **Model Selection & Weighting:** The pipeline selects source models based on availability in `haryoaw_k_models.csv` and processes similarity weights as follows:
    - **Direct Locale Matching**: Uses locale codes (en-US, fr-FR, etc.) directly without complex mapping
    - **Weight Assignment**: Each selected model receives a weight proportional to its normalized URIEL similarity to the target language
    - **Model Availability**: Only models that exist in the available models list are considered, regardless of similarity ranking
4.  **Model Merging:** The main pipeline script, `merginguriel/run_merging_pipeline_refactored.py`, combines the parameters of the selected source models using weights from the processed similarity matrix and a merging algorithm from the `auto-merge-llm` library.
5.  **Ensemble Inference:** As an alternative to parameter merging, the `merginguriel/uriel_ensemble_inference.py` system combines model outputs (logits) at inference time using URIEL similarity scores as weights, without creating a new merged model.
6.  **Evaluation:** Both merged models and ensembled predictions are evaluated on benchmark tasks to measure their performance, using scripts like `merginguriel/evaluate_base_encoder.py` and comprehensive comparison frameworks.

## 3. Environment Setup

Before running any training or merging workflows, ensure the project environment is correctly set up.

### 3.1. Activate Virtual Environment

All dependencies are managed within a Python virtual environment. Activate it using:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3.1.1. Command-Line Argument Conventions

All scripts in the MergingUriel project follow standardized command-line argument naming conventions to ensure consistency and usability. See [`CMD_ARGUMENT_CONVENTIONS.md`](CMD_ARGUMENT_CONVENTIONS.md) for complete documentation.

**Key Naming Rules:**
- **Singular form** (`--target-lang`, `--voting-method`): Used for single-target operations
- **Plural form** (`--target-languages`, `--voting-methods`): Used for batch/comparison operations
- **Kebab-case**: All arguments use lowercase with hyphens
- **Consistency**: Core arguments (`--num-languages`, `--top-k`, `--sinkhorn-iters`) are identical across all scripts

### 3.3. Testing & Quality Assurance

The project includes a comprehensive test suite organized by test type to ensure code quality and system reliability.

#### **Test Directory Structure**
```

```

#### **Test Categories**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows and system interactions
- **Verification Scripts**: Validate system properties and performance requirements

### 3.4. Hardware & Monitoring

-   **GPU:** The primary development environment is equipped with two NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. However, most individual training and merging tasks are designed to run on a single GPU.
-   **VRAM Management:** It is crucial to monitor GPU memory usage to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors, especially when working with large models or batch sizes. Use the following command to check GPU status:

    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```

### 3.3. Testing Framework

The project includes a comprehensive testing framework located in the `tests/` directory. Tests are organized by functionality and should be run before making any significant changes.

#### Available Tests:

-   **`tests/test_new_methods_simple.py`** - Validates that all new merging strategies can be created
-   **`tests/demo_new_merging_methods.py`** - User-friendly demo showing usage examples for all advanced merging methods
-   **`tests/test_all_merging_methods.py`** - Comprehensive test suite for all merging methods
-   **`tests/test_breadcrumbs_merging.py`** - Test framework for future breadcrumbs implementation

#### Running Tests:

```bash
# Quick validation of new methods
python tests/test_new_methods_simple.py

# Full demo with usage examples
python tests/demo_new_merging_methods.py

# Comprehensive testing (may take longer)
python tests/test_all_merging_methods.py
```

**Note:** All tests are designed as dry-run validation that doesn't require actual model files, making them safe to run in any environment.

## 4. Component Breakdown

This section provides a deeper look into the main components of the MergingUriel project.

### `merginguriel/` - The Core Logic

This directory is the heart of the project, containing the Python scripts that define and orchestrate the merging pipeline.

-   **`run_merging_pipeline_refactored.py`**: This is the main entry point for executing a merge. It uses a class-based, strategy pattern design to provide a flexible and extensible workflow. The `--mode` command-line argument is critical as it determines the entire behavior of the pipeline.
    -   **`MergingPipeline`**: The main orchestrator class that coordinates the steps: weight calculation, model merging, and saving the output.
    -   **`WeightCalculatorFactory`**: A factory that, based on the `--mode` argument, instantiates the correct weighting strategy. For example:
        -   `--mode similarity`: Uses `SimilarityWeightCalculator` to load weights from the pre-computed URIEL similarity matrix.
        -   `--mode average`: Uses `AverageWeightCalculator` to assign an equal weight to all source models, establishing a crucial baseline.
    -   **`MergingStrategyFactory`**: A factory that selects the underlying parameter-merging algorithm (e.g., `linear`, `fisher`).
    -   **`ModelMerger`**: The class that takes the models, weights, and merging strategy and invokes the `auto-merge-llm` library to perform the merge.
    -   **`OutputManager`**: Saves the final merged model and a `merge_details.txt` file that records the configuration used for the run.

-   **`training_bert.py`**: A standard Hugging Face `Trainer` script used to fine-tune the `xlm-roberta-base` model on individual language subsets of the `AmazonScience/massive` dataset. The models produced by this script are the raw inputs for the merging process.

-   **`similarity_utils.py`**: **NEW** Reusable module for processing URIEL similarity matrices. This is the core similarity processing system used by both merging pipeline and ensemble inference:
    - **`load_and_process_similarity()`**: Complete pipeline for loading and processing similarity matrices
    - **`process_similarity_matrix()`**: Applies top-K filtering and Sinkhorn normalization
    - **`get_similarity_weights()`**: Extracts normalized weights for target language
    - **Dynamic Top-K**: Allows runtime adjustment of how many similar languages to consider
    - **No Mapping Required**: Works directly with locale codes without complex transformations

-   **`evaluate_base_encoder.py`**: A script for evaluating a model's semantic representation capabilities on the STS-B benchmark. It calculates the Spearman correlation between the cosine similarity of sentence embeddings and the human-annotated similarity scores.

-   **`uriel_ensemble_inference.py`**: Main URIEL-guided ensemble inference system that combines model outputs at inference time using URIEL similarity scores as weights. Implements multiple voting methods including the core `uriel_logits` approach.
    -   **`uriel_weighted_logits()`**: Core algorithm implementing the section 7.3 approach - multiplies each model's logits by its URIEL similarity score and combines them.
    -   **Error Handling**: No fallback system - catches all errors to ensure complete transparency in model loading failures.
    -   **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Supports multiple voting methods for baseline comparison.

-   **`ensemble_runner.py`**: Modular experiment runner for single ensemble tests. Provides reusable functions for running individual experiments and collecting detailed results.

-   **`comparison_runner.py`**: Comprehensive comparison framework that runs experiments across multiple target languages and voting methods, providing statistical analysis and automated reporting.

-   **Files Used**:
    - **`language_similarity_matrix_unified.csv`**: Pre-computed URIEL cosine similarity matrix (50√ó50) containing similarity scores between all language pairs
    - **`haryos_model/`**: Consolidated model directory containing `xlm-roberta-base_massive_k_{locale}` models
    - **`similarity_utils.py`**: Shared processing module (replaces deprecated similarity_matrix.py)

### Model Directory Structure

The project now uses a consolidated model directory structure for better organization:

```
haryos_model/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xlm-roberta-base_massive_k_en-US/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xlm-roberta-base_massive_k_fr-FR/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (50+ locales total)
```

Each model directory contains a complete fine-tuned model with all necessary configuration files for direct loading and merging.

### `auto-merge-llm` Integration

The project leverages the `auto-merge-llm` library (located in `submodules/`) as the powerful backend for performing the parameter-level model merges. This library provides a framework and a collection of established merging algorithms.

-   **High-Level Abstraction:** `MergingUriel` uses `auto-merge-llm` as a library, abstracting away the low-level tensor manipulations. The `run_merging_pipeline_refactored.py` script acts as a high-level orchestrator that prepares models and parameters before feeding them to the selected `auto-merge-llm` method.
-   **Weighting Strategy:** The core innovation of this project is the application of a URIEL-based weighting scheme *on top of* the `auto-merge-llm` methods. The pipeline calculates typologically-informed weights and passes them as parameters (e.g., the `weights` parameter for `linear` merge, or `fisher_scaling_coefficients` for `fisher` merge) to the `auto-merge-llm` functions.

### Similarity Matrix Processing & Top-K Mechanism

The core innovation of MergingUriel is the dynamic processing of URIEL similarity matrices with configurable top-K filtering:

#### **Processing Pipeline**
1. **Load Pre-computed Matrix**: Uses `language_similarity_matrix_unified.csv` containing cosine similarity scores between 50 languages
2. **Top-K Filtering**: For target language T, retains only the K most similar languages (configurable via `--top-k`)
3. **Sinkhorn Normalization**: Applies Sinkhorn algorithm to make the filtered weights doubly stochastic (rows sum to 1.0)
4. **Model Matching**: Direct locale matching with available models in `haryoaw_k_models.csv`

#### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Top-K**: Experiment with different numbers of source languages without regenerating matrices
- **Flexible Filtering**: Try different top-K values (5, 10, 20) to find optimal ensemble size
- **Automatic Normalization**: Ensures weights always sum to 1.0 regardless of top-K setting
- **Model Availability**: Only considers models that actually exist in the model repository

#### **Example Processing Flow**
```python
# Target: fr-FR, Top-K: 5
# 1. Get top 5 most similar languages: [ar-SA, af-ZA, cy-GB, lv-LV, nl-NL]
# 2. Apply Sinkhorn normalization: [0.094, 0.084, 0.062, 0.052, 0.049]
# 3. Match with available models: [ar-SA, en-US, de-DE, sq-AL, it-IT]
# 4. Final weights: [0.094, 0.046, 0.046, 0.045, 0.043]
```

#### **Configuration Parameters**
- `--top-k 20`: Number of similar languages to consider (default: 20)
- `--sinkhorn-iters 20`: Sinkhorn normalization iterations (default: 20)
- `--num-languages 5`: Maximum number of models to actually use (default: 5)

#### **Enhanced Similarity Processing**
The system supports both sparse and dense similarity computation:

- **Sparse Mode (Default)**: Uses pre-computed similarity matrix with top-K filtering
- **Dense Mode**: Computes similarities on-the-fly using URIEL features with configurable top-K and Sinkhorn normalization
- **Dynamic Top-K**: Experiment with different numbers of source languages without regenerating matrices
- **Flexible Filtering**: Try different top-K values (5, 10, 20) to find optimal ensemble size
- **Automatic Normalization**: Ensures weights always sum to 1.0 regardless of top-K setting

## 5. Supported Merging Methods & Baselines

To scientifically validate the effectiveness of URIEL-guided merging, every experiment is compared against a strong baseline. The `--mode` flag in `run_merging_pipeline_refactored.py` controls which approach is used.

-   **URIEL-Weighted (`--mode similarity`):** Merges the top-N models using weights derived from the URIEL similarity matrix.
-   **Average Baseline (`--mode average`):** Merges the *same* top-N models but assigns each an equal weight (1/N). This isolates the impact of the URIEL weighting scheme itself.

Below is the status of the merging algorithms from `auto-merge-llm` that are currently integrated into this pipeline.

| Merging Method (from auto-merge-llm) | Description | Status in MergingUriel | URIEL Weighting Support | Baseline Comparison |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `linear` | A simple weighted average of model parameters. | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode average` |
| `fisher` | Estimates parameter importance using gradients from a sample dataset (primary Fisher method). | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--preweight equal` |
| `fisher_simple` | Weights parameters by their magnitude as a proxy for importance (class retained, option removed). | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode average` |
| `fisher_dataset` | Fisher dataset-based method (now mapped to `--mode fisher`). | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--preweight equal` |
| `ties` | Merges models by resolving sign disagreements and pruning low-magnitude weights. | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode ties` |
| `slerp` | Spherical Linear Interpolation, useful for interpolating between models. | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode serp` |
| `task_arithmetic` | Adds or subtracts task vectors representing fine-tuning changes. | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode task_arithmetic` |
| `dare` | A state-of-the-art method that prunes and rescales task vectors before merging. | **Implemented*** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode task_arithmetic --param_value_mask_rate` |
| `regmean` | A method that uses regression to find optimal merging coefficients. | **Implemented** | Yes | Yes, via `--mode regmean` |
| `breadcrumbs` | A method for merging models by analyzing their training trajectories. | Not Implemented | No | No |

*DARE functionality is available through `task_arithmetic` with pruning parameters (`param_value_mask_rate`).

### 5.1. Additional Evaluation Baselines

Beyond the "Average Merge" baseline, the performance of merged models is contextualized by comparing them against strong single-model baselines. These are derived from a comprehensive N-vs-N evaluation performed by the `merginguriel/run_nxn_evaluation.py` script.

-   **Best Source Language Baseline:** For a given merge of N models, this is the accuracy of the single best-performing model *from that specific set of N source models* when evaluated on the target language's test set. This tells us if the merge is better than simply picking the best available component.
-   **Best Overall Zero-Shot Baseline:** This is the highest accuracy achieved by *any* single language model (excluding the target language itself) on the target language's test set. This represents the state-of-the-art for zero-shot transfer without merging.

*Note: The automatic inclusion of these baselines in the final report is a key objective of the refactoring effort detailed in Section 7.4.*
